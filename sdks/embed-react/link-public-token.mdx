description: How to generate a link public token for your affiliate links
---

The link public token is a crucial component for securely embedding the Dub widget in your app.

To generate a link public token, you must possess a **Workspace API key** that has the `links.write` scope. This scope grants the permission to generate tokens for links.

The link public token is scoped to a specific link, meaning it can only be used in the context of that link.

Additionally, for security purposes, the token is designed to expire after **2 hours**. This limited lifespan helps to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.

It's important to implement a logic that listens for the token's expiration event so that a new token can be generated and used when the current one expires.

The link for which you are generating a token must be part of an affiliate program otherwise the request to generate a token will not succeed.

You can generate a link public token by using following methods:

<CodeGroup>

```bash curl
curl -X POST https://api.dub.co/tokens/embed \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer DUB_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"linkId": "LINK_ID"}'
```

```bash TypeScript
import { Dub } from "dub";

const dub = new Dub({
  token: "DUB_API_KEY",
});

const token = await dub.tokens.createEmbed({
  linkId: "LINK_ID",
});
```

</CodeGroup>

You should generate the token on the **server side** and pass it to the widget. Ideally you should create a new endpoint on your application that will generate the token and return it to the client based on the link ID.

Ensure that the token is included in the widget's configuration to enable it to fetch and display the necessary data.
