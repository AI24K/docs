`@dub/analytics` is a lightweight (\<1kb), [open-source](https://github.com/dubinc/analytics) client-side script used for tracking conversions with [Dub Conversions](https://dub.co/help/article/dub-conversions).

The script handles the detection of the `dub_id` query parameter and storing it as a first-party cookie, which will be used to attribute subsequent conversion events to the original link.

With the script, you can also [track clicks on the client-side](/conversions/clicks/introduction#client-side-click-tracking) using query parameters (e.g. `?via=john`). This gives you the flexibility to track clicks directly on your website or app, without needing to rely on link redirects.
