description: Click-tracking with Dub Conversions
---

import DubAnalyticsParams from "/snippets/dub-analytics-params.mdx";

Clicks are the starting point for all conversion events on Dub.

A click event can be triggered by:

- A user clicking on a [Dub link](https://dub.co/help/article/how-to-create-link)
- A user scanning a [Dub QR code](https://dub.co/features/qr-codes)

In [Dub Analytics](https://dub.co/help/article/dub-analytics), you can [filter between QR code scans and link clicks](https://dub.co/help/article/filter-analytics-by-trigger), giving you a full picture of how your various marketing channels are performing.

Clicks are tracked automatically for all Dub short links upon a redirect event – and you also have the flexibility to track clicks via query parameters using our [Client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction).

## Server-side click-tracking

Server-side click-tracking is enabled by default for all Dub links and come with the following attributes:

| Attribute    | Type    | Description                                                                                      |
| :----------- | :------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `timestamp`  | string  | The timestamp of the click event                                                                 |
| `id`         | string  | The unique ID of the click event                                                                 |
| `url`        | string  | The destination URL that the link resolved to – this can vary if geo/device-targeting is enabled |
| `continent`  | string  | The continent of the user who clicked the link                                                   |
| `country`    | string  | The country of the user who clicked the link                                                     |
| `city`       | string  | The city of the user who clicked the link                                                        |
| `device`     | string  | The device of the user who clicked the link                                                      |
| `browser`    | string  | The browser of the user who clicked the link                                                     |
| `os`         | string  | The operating system of the user who clicked the link                                            |

| `refererUrl` | string  | The full referrer URL of the user who clicked the link                                           |
| `qr`         | boolean | Whether the click event was triggered by a QR code scan                                          |
| `ip`         | string  | The IP address of the user who clicked the link (non-EU users only)                              |

These events happen on the server-side and cannot be blocked by browser extensions or ad-blockers, which improves the accuracy of your analytics data.

## Client-side click-tracking

Alternatively, you can track clicks on the client-side using query parameters (e.g. `?via=john`, `?ref=jane`). This gives you the flexibility to track clicks directly on your website or app, without needing to rely on link redirects.

A few use cases include:

- You are migrating from an existing affiliate management platform that uses query parameters to track conversions and don't want ask your affiliates to update all their links
- You need to use an unfurled URL for the platform you're sharing the link on (no short links allowed)
- You have dynamically generated referral pages (e.g. [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/referral/peeroke520149)) and want to track clicks using a `track()` function inside your application code.

With our [Client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction), you can do exactly that.

Here's how you can enable client-side click-tracking for your links:

### Step 1: Add a unique `identifier` to your links

First, you need to add a unique `identifier` to your links. This `identifier` is unique across your workspace and will be used to identify the corresponding link when passed as the query parameter (e.g. `?via=jane`).

There are two ways to add an `identifier` to your links:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Using the Dub Link Builder">

1. Inside the Dub Link Builder, click on the **More options** button and select **Advanced Settings**. You can also use the `A` keyboard shortcut.

<Frame>
  <img
    className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
    src="/images/link-builder-advanced-settings.png"
    alt="Dub Link Builder Advanced Settings"
  />
</Frame>

2. Under the **Identifier** section, enter a unique value that corresponds to the query parameter you want to use for the click-tracking.

<Frame>
  <img
    className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
    src="/images/link-builder-identifier.png"
    alt="Dub Link Builder Identifier"
  />
</Frame>

3. Click on the **Save** button to save the changes.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Using the Dub API">

If you're using the [Dub API](/api-reference/introduction) to programmatically create your links, you can use the `identifier` field to specify the unique identifier for the link.

Here's an example of how to create a link with a custom `identifier`:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
await dub.links.create({
  url: "https://google.com",
  identifier: "my-custom-identifier",
});
```

```python Python
res = d.links.create(request={
    url: "https://google.com",
    identifier: "my-custom-identifier",
});
```

```go Go
func main() {
    s := dubgo.New(
        dubgo.WithSecurity("DUB_API_KEY"),
    )

    ctx := context.Background()
    res, err := s.Links.Create(ctx, &operations.CreateLinkRequestBody{
        URL: "https://google.com",
        Identifier: "my-custom-identifier",
    })
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    if res != nil {
        // handle response
    }
}
```

```ruby Ruby
req = ::OpenApiSDK::Operations::CreateLinkRequestBody.new(
  url: "https://google.com",
  identifier: "my-custom-identifier",
)

res = s.links.create(req)
```

</CodeGroup>
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Create a Publishable Key

Next, you'll need to create a [Publishable Key](/sdks/client-side/publishable-keys) that you'll use to initialize the [Client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction). The key has the following format:

```
dub_publishable_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

You can create a Publishable Key in the [**Tokens** settings page](https://app.dub.co/settings/tokens) in your Dub workspace.

### Step 3: Install the Client-side SDK

Lastly, you'll need to install the [Client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction) and initialize it with the Publishable Key you created in the previous step.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript React/Next.js
// install the package (e.g. npm install @dub/analytics)
import { Analytics as DubAnalytics } from "@dub/analytics/react";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <DubAnalytics
        apiKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DUB_PUBLISHABLE_KEY}
        queryParam="referral" // default is "via"
      />
      {/* Your app code here */}
    </Layout>
  );
}
```

```javascript Other Frameworks
// include this script tag in your HTML Head tag
<script
  src="https://www.dubcdn.com/analytics/script.js"
  apiKey="YOUR_DUB_PUBLISHABLE_KEY"
  defer
  queryParam="referral" // default is "via"
/>
```

</CodeGroup>

Here's the full list of parameters you can pass to the `<Analytics />` component:

<Accordion title="Parameters">
  <DubAnalyticsParams />
</Accordion>

### Step 4 (Optional, but recommended): Set up a reverse proxy

To avoid ad-blockers from blocking your click-tracking requests, we recommend setting up a reverse proxy.

Depending on which backend framework you're using, there are a few different ways to do this:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Next.js
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  async rewrites() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/_proxy/dub/track/click",
        destination: "https://api.dub.co/track/click",
      },
    ];
  },
};
```

```json Vercel
// vercel.json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/_proxy/dub/track/click",
      "destination": "https://api.dub.co/track/click"
    }
  ]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

Once you've set up your reverse proxy, don't forget to update the `apiHost` parameter in the `<Analytics />` component to point to your proxy URL.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript React/Next.js
import { Analytics as DubAnalytics } from "@dub/analytics/react";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <DubAnalytics
        apiHost="/_proxy/dub"
        apiKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DUB_PUBLISHABLE_KEY}
        queryParam="referral" // default is "via"
      />
      {/* Your app code here */}
    </Layout>
  );
}
```

```javascript Other Frameworks
// include this script tag in your HTML Head tag
<script
  src="https://www.dubcdn.com/analytics/script.js"
  apiHost="/_proxy/dub"
  apiKey="YOUR_DUB_PUBLISHABLE_KEY"
  defer
  queryParam="referral" // default is "via"
/>
```

</CodeGroup>

### Step 5: Verify your setup

To verify that your click-tracking is working, run your website locally with the specific query parameter (e.g. `?via=jane`) and check if the following is true:

1. The click tracked correctly in the [**Analytics**](https://app.dub.co/analytics) tab of your Dub workspace.
2. There is a successful `/track/click` request in your browser's **Network** tab (and no errors in the **Console** tab).
3. The `dub_id` cookie is being set in your browser upon a successful click-tracking request.
