When it comes to conversion tracking, a `sale` event happens when a user purchases a product from your Shopify store.

## Step 1: Install the Dub Shopify app

<Steps>

<Step title="Install the app">
  Install the [Dub Shopify App](https://d.to/shopify) from the App Store.

</Step>

<Step title="Connect the Dub workspace">
  After installation, you will be prompted to link one of your Dub workspaces to
  the app. Select **Connect** to establish a connection between your
  Shopify store and your Dub workspace.

You'll be redirected back to your Shopify store after this step and you should
see the connection status in the app.

</Step>

<Step title="Activate Dub Analytics Script">
  After installing the Dub Conversions app, the Dub Analytics script is added as an app embed. However, it needs to be activated manually to ensure it is included in your current theme.

To activate the Dub Analytics script, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your Shopify admin panel.
2. Go to **Online Store** > **Themes**.
3. Click on **Customize** for your current theme.
4. In the theme editor, select the **App embeds** tab.
5. Locate the **Analytics Script** for the Dub Conversions app and toggle it to activate.

</Step>

</Steps>

Dub’s Shopify integration will automatically forward the following events to Dub:

- `orders/paid`: This event is triggered when a customer completes a purchase on your Shopify store. It is utilized to track sales that originate from Dub links.
- `app/uninstalled`: This event occurs when the app is uninstalled from a store. It is used to remove the integration from your Dub workspace.

In addition to the above, we also subscribe to the mandatory compliance webhook topics that are required by Shopify.
