The pagination feature allows you to retrieve a subset of resources from the API. This is useful when you have a large number of resources and you want to retrieve them in smaller chunks.

These list API methods share a common set of parameters that allow you to control the number of items returned and the page number. For example, you can [list links](/api-reference/endpoint/retrieve-a-list-of-links), or [list domains](/api-reference/endpoint/retrieve-a-list-of-domains).

## Parameters

<ParamField body="page" type="string" default="1">
  The page number to retrieve. By default, the first page is returned.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="pageSize" type="string">
  The number of items to retrieve per page. The default value varies by
  endpoint. Maximum value is 100.
</ParamField>

## Example

The following example demonstrates how to retrieve the second page of 10 links:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.dub.co/links?page=2&pageSize=10 \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
```
