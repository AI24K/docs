Links are the bread and butter of [Dub](https://dub.co).

Everything on Dub starts with a link. Whether you're creating:

- a handful of links for your marketing campaign
- hundreds of links for your affiliate program
- thousands of links, [programmatically](/api-reference/endpoint/bulk-create-links), for your SMS campaign

In this guide, we'll cover the link model, how to create links, and more.

## The link model

The link model consists of the following properties:
